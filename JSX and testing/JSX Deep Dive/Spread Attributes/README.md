### A simple welcome screen for Little Lemon restaurant has been built, where users are able to sign up or login, depending on whether they have an account or not. The App component renders two buttons and uses the Button component for the sign up and the LoginButton component for log in. Both buttons make use of the onClick handler, to show an alert about the intended action when they are pressed. The same alert message that has been provided for Sign up, is used on the LoginButton component, hence overriding the onClick handler that the LoginButton already defines internally. What would the message of the alert be when the Sign up button is clicked?

- [x] Logging in.
- [ ] Signing up.
